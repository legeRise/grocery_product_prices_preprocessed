This repo contains the price datasets of following grocery products
1. Sugar
2. Rice
3. Potato
4. Tomato
5. Chicken
6. Eggs
7. Milk
as well as 'Petrol' before and after Preprocessing(Cleaning)

Since all the datsets were collected from the same source( https://portal.karandaaz.com.pk/ ) and follow
similar attributes and datapoints, a single notebook is enough to clean all of them. It's just about 
loading file and change file name in pd.read_csv()  and also in data.to_csv()
